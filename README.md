# Strip_Me_Up

First ever API built by me using Django REST framework. This API basically returns a stripped URL when feeded with a long URL or any URL which is needed to be shorten. Well, it was easy dealing with it. But need to learn more to go deeper into the concepts of Django REST framework.

# More on Django REST framework

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
* Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.
* Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.
